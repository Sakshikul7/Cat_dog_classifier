Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Explanation
The notebook you've created is structured to classify images of cats and dogs using a CNN model. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

Step 1: Importing Required Libraries
The first step involves importing the necessary libraries:

TensorFlow & Keras for building and training the CNN.
Libraries like os, matplotlib, and numpy are used for data handling, visualization, and numerical operations.
Step 2: Loading and Preprocessing the Dataset
The dataset is expected to contain labeled images of cats and dogs.
The images are loaded using tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory, which organizes images into batches, resizes them, and normalizes pixel values.
The images are usually resized to a fixed shape (e.g., 150x150) and normalized (dividing pixel values by 255).
Step 3: Building the CNN Model
The model architecture typically consists of:

Convolutional Layers (Conv2D): Extracts features from images using filters.
MaxPooling Layers: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, helping to retain important features while reducing computation.
Flatten Layer: Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
Dense (Fully Connected) Layers: Performs classification based on the features extracted by the convolutional layers.
Dropout Layers: Helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping some neurons during training.
Step 4: Compiling the Model
The model is compiled using:

Binary Cross-Entropy Loss: Suitable for binary classification tasks.
Adam Optimizer: A popular choice for optimizing deep learning models.
Accuracy Metric: To evaluate the model’s performance.
Step 5: Training the Model
The model is trained using the training dataset and validated using a separate validation set. This step typically involves:

Specifying the number of epochs (e.g., 10-20).
Monitoring the training and validation accuracy/loss to avoid overfitting.
Step 6: Evaluating the Model
After training, the model’s performance is evaluated on a test dataset. Metrics such as accuracy and loss are computed.
